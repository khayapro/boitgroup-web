                    <q><i>Rock Star of public Speaking</i></q>
					<p>At the age of 17, Vusi was already ranked 1st in Africa for public speaking and went on to receive a 3rd in the world
						at the English Speaking Union International Competition. He speaks in 4 of the 7 continents to over 350 000
						people each year! He delivered over 200 keynotes in 2011 alone. At 25 years-old he was the youngest director
						of a multi-national turning over R17bn a year, where he served on the operations board. His humour is the glue that
						binds some of his most diverse audiences in the world. John Howard, former Prime Minister of Australia called Vusi
						the “Rock Star of Public Speaking” and global strategist & scenario-planning guru Clem Sunter said he was “simply
						riveting while Sir Bob Geldof said “Vusi is a f*kcen great speaker”. <br><br>
						At 21 he ran his own successful consulting firm,
						then South Africa’s only black-owned Forensic Marketing agency. By 25 Vusi Thembekwayo was an executive at one
						of the largest consumer goods businesses in Africa. There he started, grew & managed a multi-million dollar portfolio.
						Today at 28, he is the Managing Director of MOTIV8 Advisory – a specialist consulting and services agency & serves on the
						board of international consulting firm Black Sheep Advisory Ltd as well as the founding Partner of Speakers BootCamp (S.A)<br><br>
                        Today Vusi is the MD of a boutique investment and advisory firm that assists medium, large and listed businesses to achieve step-change results through their people. He has been

				<p>For Malik, music has always been the food of love. When times looked awry during his
					childhood, it was always music that brought the comfort and joy he sought. It was music
					that provided the escape he needed. Music became his life and so began the journey to
					pursue a musical career. Being the only member of his family to have been bitten by the
					music bug, Malik didn’t have it easy. His family didn’t understand his unswerving
					devotion to music. “They were so protective. They feared that I would pursue a career in
					music, which frightened them because they always believed that there was something
					better for me to go after,” says Malik.<br><br>
					From a tender age Malik had attracted audience attention due to his captivating voice.
					He sang in a church choir and was always the envy of everyone because he was a
					communicative singer and performer. After finishing matric, his family encouraged him
					to take up a “respectable” career path. He enrolled to study Bio Technology at the
					Tshwane University of Technology. After completion of his studies, he was fortunate to
					land a job at a Coca Cola lab. “It just didn’t feel right; I didn’t like it one bit and so I
					quit. My mom freaked out, but I had to follow my heart,” he recalls.<br><br>

					Following that, Malik began his pursuit of a career in music. He met up with a friend
					Kyllex Faku, with whom he worked on the production side of things. He played around
					on his guitar writing music that he didn’t know would later be published. He worked
					with a number of people, honing his skills and learning the art of music. As fate would
					have it, he was later introduced to some of the industry giants, for whom and with whom
					he would later produce award-winning songs. Some of the notable giants include the
					likes of Ringo Madlingozi and Zola 7.</p>

				<p>Hip Hop Pantsula (real name is Jabulani Tsambo) is a popular South African Motswako hip hop emcee who frequently performs
                    in ethnic languages, though mostly Setswana. His hits include the single from his O Mang Reloaded album, "Tswaka", "Jabba"
                    and "Tshwara" (the latter both from YBA 2 NW). <br><br>
                    He was initially part of a group called Verbal Assassins, working closely with producer Tebogo Rameetse. Pantsula's break
                    came in 1997 when he and his school friends met with producer Chicco Twala who produced their debut "Party". The band split
                    soon after the release of "Party". Tsambo met singer–producer Isaac Mthethwa who then worked on his debut album. In 2004 HHP
                    released O Mang, an album that saw him reuniting with his old school friend, Tebogo Rameetse as the producer of a track entitled
                    On My Own. The remix of this track, produced by "Beatmaker" earned him critical acclaim.Pantsula appeared on the third one-off
                    TV special of quiz show Test The Nation, titled "National Parenting Test", as the Team Captain representing fathers. In 2007,
                    he won the third season of the reality dance show Strictly Come Dancing along with his professional dance partner Hayley

                    Do You Think You Are” on SABC2 in 2009, a show that delved into the family history of celebrities, tracing their ancestry
                    and revealing secrets and surprises from their pasts. He was honoured in September 2007 in the inaugural Mafikeng Golden Stars

                <p>Ran Neu-Ner was a born entrepreneur. At the age of three-and-a-half, he learnt to use a
                    pair of scissors, cut out some pictures from a calendar and went selling them door to
                    door in his neighbourhood. He was out all night and returned home with a pocketful of
                    money to find a convoy of police cars waiting for him.<br><br>
                    His appetite for business whetted by this early success, Neu-Ner continued with more
                    sophisticated endeavours throughout his school career. He graduated from university
                    with a B.Com and a CFA, and, having added qualification to entrepreneurial drive, was
                    unleashed onto the world of real business. <br><br>
                    After a number of business ventures – some hugely successful and some not – Neu-Ner
                    started The Creative Counsel, a below-the-line activations company, with school friend
                    Gil Oved in 2001. Although neither of them had any experience in the activations
                    industry, Neu-Ner says, business is business, whether you're selling cabbages or cars.
                    Both partners gave the fledgling company everything that they had.</p>

                <p>Since he was a schoolboy Simon Mtsuki has been known as ‘Mr. Big Mouth’. He was famous for
                    butting into old people’s conversations, disrupting classes and back-chatting teachers. This also
                    earned him a couple of infamous prizes: He is the undisputed champion of detention in his primary
                    school, he was the first student ever to earn himself a place next to the principals office because of his
                    big mouth and a series of appointments to a psychologist after his teachers unanimously agreed there
                    was something wrong with him.<br><br>
                    <q>I caused my mother a lot of stress, but I don’t think I was really a mischievous kid, I was just a kid
                    who had not found his talent.</q> he says.<br><br>
                    After being expelled from a private Christian school at the end of Grade 9, Simon stumbled upon the
                    art of public speaking. In grade 10 he achieved 2nd place in his first ever schools speech competition
                    in Emalahleni. In 2005 while in Grade 11 Simon Mtsuki was elected Member of Youth Parliament of
                    Mpumalanga, after a speech to the regional council. In the same year he met Vusi Thembekwayo at a
                    Thuthuka Development Camp and took some of his advice about launching a speaking career. His
                    first motivational talk was to teachers of Hoerskool Patriot in 2005. From then on he built his profile,
                    as a motivational speaker and in 2006 (at the age of 18) he signed his first client, The South African
                    Institute of Chartered Accountants: Thuthuka Development Camp, a relationship that he has
                    maintained for the 8 years.<br><br>
                    While studying for his B.Comm Accounting at the University of the Witwatersrand he pursued his
                    speaking. He spoke to student audiences at Wits resident houses, official student events and student
                    development bodies such as the Student Sponsorship Programmes. When he graduated in 2011 he
                    decided to pursue his passion for speaking, focusing specifically on Student and Youth Development.</p>

                <p>Her debut appearance as the funny, flirtatious gossiping Anele, on Mzansi Magic’s
                    Inkaba, quickly made Dawn a household name. What people do not know about her
                    though, is that acting has always been Dawn’s passion and started this at a very young
                    age.
                    This humble and extraordinary actress hails from Durban, where she studied Drama at
                    Technikon Natal. During her tenure at Natal Technikon, she starred in many stage plays,
                    including Peace in The Valley, which debuted at the Playhouse Theatre in 2000, and was
                    directed by one of KZN’s most acclaimed playwrights, Jerry Pooe. Working with such
                    phenomenal directors, exposed Dawn’s many talents, in acting, singing and dancing. Her
                    talents don’t end there. Dawn has experience as a radio actress,motivational speaker,
                    MC and an indigenous musician .<br><br>
                    As an ambitious young woman, she joined the corporate world for a brief period, but
                    soon realized she would rather be on stage and back to what she does best, acting and
                    entertainment. She landed a role in Mzansi Magic’s INKABA in 2012.
                    Since then, Dawn has also worked tirelessly to make her name in the industry. In 2012, Dawn embarked on a 3 day tour-motivating schools in Northern KZN and she
                    was well received by both teachers and students. She performed her indigenous music at the Land Reform exhibition in NASREC in August 2013, and was invited to
                    perform at The Plat4orm theatre in Bezuidenhoed in Johannesburg, for Woman’s month in 2013, and shot a short film called Black Silence, in November 2013.<br><br>
                    Dawn was recalled to perform her indigenous music, at The Land Reform Exhibition in February 2014 this time held at the Event s Exhibition Center in Pretoria. 2014
                    has been a very busy year for Dawn, as she has also been involved in 2 short films called Untitled and Hlezephi, which were directed by Rethabile Mathobi and Tony
                    Miyambo. These short films were part of the Youth Film Project called Mandela's children.
                    Dawn has also landed a role in a coca cola commercial, which is running currently. In July 2014, Dawn was invited to be part of the cast of Eclipsed joining four other
                    phenomenal woman, the production was directed by Warona Seane and had a 3 week run at the Soweto Theatre.

                <p>The perfect way to describe Fikile is - the strong and excellent woman who loves God
                    more than anything. A virtuous wife to her loving husband and she is impacting the lives
                    of others. She’s a success, a global fire brand, an extraordinary resource and an
                    ambassador of change. She came for a mission and her purpose is very clear... “To
                    touch and change lives...” And that is very visible as South Africa knows her as a Lady
                    with a big heart. She has partnered with the public, private and government sector to
                    bring a change. Given inspirational talks in different sectors in South Africa, Judged
                    Leadership programs, pageants and Speech Contests.<br><br>
                    Fikile has touch touched so many lives through her speaking engagement. She has been
                    speaking in different events and also has graced many occasions as an exceptional MC.
                    Not only that – she has been part of so many seminars as her passion is to build an
                    develop others. The need for women development she saw as she travels around South
                    Africa to conduct seminars made her start her monthly seminar called – Dynamic You
                    Breakfast Session With Fikile Mekgoe” And these sessions have attracted many women
                    from all walks of life – as they all want to hear her deliver her keynote speeches.<br><br>
                    Fikile lives to leave a legacy and yes she is that beauty queen who won a title and used
                    her resources to serve her country. And the best achievement she has achieved – is to
                    accept Jesus Christ as her Lord and saviour. That day marked the beginning of her
                    Devine life on earth!</p>

                <p>Serial entrepreneur, Gil Oved believes the day he can define his business is the day he
                    will be out of business. Co-founder and group co-CEO of The Creative Counsel, Oved’s
                    mantra ‘Passion fueled optimism’ has seen him soar to great success in his business
                    career. At 15 Gil Oved began his career as an actor, starring in a television series, “What
                    If,” and then, on the shoulders of that success, went on to present a youth magazine
                    show, Zap Mag for eight years.<br><br>
                    Although acting was a passion, he soon found that he had a greater interest in working
                    behind the scenes to produce inserts for the show. With entrepreneurial spirit and desire
                    to work in a creative medium he founded his first company, a TV production company
                    called GO Productions. He later founded Jewazi Productions with a partner in the mind
                    nineties, during what he describes as “an incredible time in South Africa”.<br><br>
                    Although he loved what he was doing, he was hungry for something more, so he and his
                    high school friend Ran Neu-Ner started an online stockbroking portal with the aim of
                    becoming Internet millionaires. Unfortunately, their timing was a somewhat off and their
                    investor went under when the dotcom bubble burst. They were left looking for a new
                    venture into which to direct their energy and passion.<br><br>
                    Oved completed a B.Com in Marketing cum laude and a CFA, stacking up the credentials effectively to run and promote his next business venture. The opportunity came in the
                    form of a gap that he and Neu-Ner identified in the below-the-line activations market and were determined to fill.
                    In 2001, they started The Creative Counsel. Oved and Neu-Ner's entrepreneurial spirit was tested but never stifled by financial challenges and the challenges of breaking into a
                    new market. In this business, Oved was able to give expression to all his passions – business, marketing and producing. Even his acting skills came in handy when defining how
                    to appeal to an audience and developing training methodologies for their activations.
                    Today, thirteen years later, The Creative Counsel is South Africa's leading activations agency and ranks as the top Marketing , Media and Advertising group in the country. The
                    company has an annual turnover of R500 million, and Oved and Neu-Ner serve as Group Co- CEOs.
                    Oved focuses on the bigger picture and the small details. He's a Leo, loves classical movies, globetrotting, is a self-confessed foodie and vigorously follows American politics.</p>

                <p>Jeremy Campion was born in England, but it was while living in South Africa that he
                    decided to turn a passion for photography into a career. An avid golfer, he recognized a
                    void for great action golf photography. Over the past 20 years his photographs have
                    appeared in numerous world wide publications, including Golf Digest, UK Telegraph,
                    UKDaily Express, Washington Post and The Compleat Golfer.<br><br>
                    On his regular pilgrimages to the Open Championship, he has recorded the joy and
                    despair of great players on some of the world's most challenging and respected golf
                    courses. In 1994, he was the only photographer to capture Nick Price’s amazing 17th
                    hole eagle putt that secured his victory. The photograph was published around the world.
                    His other world scoop was to capture the first female streaker, when Royal Birkdale
                    hosted The Championship in 1991.
                    Along with golf, Jeremy has also photographed multiple International Corporate Events
                    on a regular repeat basis.<br><br>
                    In February 2004, Jeremy was granted a rare O1 Visa (Extraordinary Ability in the Arts
                    Petition), allowing him to live and work in the United States. For this, one has to
                    document proven extraordinary ability. In his case these were photographs of unusual,
                    exciting and memorable events published in distinguished newspapers, books and
                    magazines, coupled with multiple letters from prominent personalities confirming
                    significant recognition of his expertise and achievements.<br><br>
                    Jeremy is a highly skilled photographer in portraits, corporate events, weddings &
                    modelling, as well as of course, golf. His natural spontaneous personality and good
                    humour brings out the best in people. A session with him is an upbeat, fun, yet relaxing
                    experience, producing extraordinary photographs.</p></div>
