					education right after matric. “But God had a purpose” he says.<br>
					Percy is a founder of Vision 2015, an NGO established a decade ago in year 2000 after graduating from
					Vaal Triangle Technikon. The Mission of Vision2015 is to bridge Digital Divide in South Africa because

					Alcatel SA, SABC, Vision 2015 can boast that 90% of the schools in South Africa have their signature (Vision2015)
					because of the computers at their schools.<br>
					In 2010, Percy opened Mphaho Holding Company that currently has four companies namely, Presley Info Tech (IT Company),
					Neocomit (IT retail stores), PM Minerals (Minerals and Energy), Lim Taba Tours (Transport and Accommodation).
					In 2012, PM minerals secured 4000 hectares of land in Waterburg Lephalale to do exploration of Coal mining to date.

					He also was a manager of Caster Semenya, 800 meter South African Sports Athletic Champion, during the time of her glory.

				<p>For Malik, music has always been the food of love. When times looked awry during his
					childhood, it was always music that brought the comfort and joy he sought. It was music
					that provided the escape he needed. Music became his life and so began the journey to
					pursue a musical career. Being the only member of his family to have been bitten by the
					music bug, Malik didn’t have it easy. His family didn’t understand his unswerving
					devotion to music. “They were so protective. They feared that I would pursue a career in
					music, which frightened them because they always believed that there was something
					better for me to go after,” says Malik.<br><br>
					From a tender age Malik had attracted audience attention due to his captivating voice.
					He sang in a church choir and was always the envy of everyone because he was a
					communicative singer and performer. After finishing matric, his family encouraged him
					to take up a “respectable” career path. He enrolled to study Bio Technology at the
					Tshwane University of Technology. After completion of his studies, he was fortunate to
					land a job at a Coca Cola lab. “It just didn’t feel right; I didn’t like it one bit and so I
					quit. My mom freaked out, but I had to follow my heart,” he recalls.<br><br>

					Following that, Malik began his pursuit of a career in music. He met up with a friend
					Kyllex Faku, with whom he worked on the production side of things. He played around
					on his guitar writing music that he didn’t know would later be published. He worked
					with a number of people, honing his skills and learning the art of music. As fate would
					have it, he was later introduced to some of the industry giants, for whom and with whom
					he would later produce award-winning songs. Some of the notable giants include the
					likes of Ringo Madlingozi and Zola 7.</p>

				<p>Hip Hop Pantsula (real name is Jabulani Tsambo) is a popular South African Motswako hip hop emcee who frequently performs
                    in ethnic languages, though mostly Setswana. His hits include the single from his O Mang Reloaded album, "Tswaka", "Jabba"
                    and "Tshwara" (the latter both from YBA 2 NW). <br><br>
                    He was initially part of a group called Verbal Assassins, working closely with producer Tebogo Rameetse. Pantsula's break
                    came in 1997 when he and his school friends met with producer Chicco Twala who produced their debut "Party". The band split
                    soon after the release of "Party". Tsambo met singer–producer Isaac Mthethwa who then worked on his debut album. In 2004 HHP
                    released O Mang, an album that saw him reuniting with his old school friend, Tebogo Rameetse as the producer of a track entitled
                    On My Own. The remix of this track, produced by "Beatmaker" earned him critical acclaim.Pantsula appeared on the third one-off
                    TV special of quiz show Test The Nation, titled "National Parenting Test", as the Team Captain representing fathers. In 2007,
                    he won the third season of the reality dance show Strictly Come Dancing along with his professional dance partner Hayley
                    Bennet.<br><br>

                    Do You Think You Are” on SABC2 in 2009, a show that delved into the family history of celebrities, tracing their ancestry
                    and revealing secrets and surprises from their pasts. He was honoured in September 2007 in the inaugural Mafikeng Golden Stars
                    Awards held at the Mmabana Convention Centre. Jabulani Tsambo (aka Hip Hop Pantsula) also won an MTV Africa Music Award for
                    Best Video in 2009 (Mpitse).  He worked with Nas and Amerie and received a 2010 BET Award nomination for Best International
                    Act. HHP  is known by his great sense of humour, multitudes of fans, style of music  and his variances have made everyone,

                <p>Ran Neu-Ner was a born entrepreneur. At the age of three-and-a-half, he learnt to use a
                    pair of scissors, cut out some pictures from a calendar and went selling them door to
                    door in his neighbourhood. He was out all night and returned home with a pocketful of
                    money to find a convoy of police cars waiting for him.<br><br>
                    His appetite for business whetted by this early success, Neu-Ner continued with more
                    sophisticated endeavours throughout his school career. He graduated from university
                    with a B.Com and a CFA, and, having added qualification to entrepreneurial drive, was
                    unleashed onto the world of real business. <br><br>
                    After a number of business ventures – some hugely successful and some not – Neu-Ner
                    started The Creative Counsel, a below-the-line activations company, with school friend
                    Gil Oved in 2001. Although neither of them had any experience in the activations
                    industry, Neu-Ner says, business is business, whether you're selling cabbages or cars.
                    Both partners gave the fledgling company everything that they had.</p>

                <p>Since he was a schoolboy Simon Mtsuki has been known as ‘Mr. Big Mouth’. He was famous for
                    butting into old people’s conversations, disrupting classes and back-chatting teachers. This also
                    earned him a couple of infamous prizes: He is the undisputed champion of detention in his primary
                    school, he was the first student ever to earn himself a place next to the principals office because of his
                    big mouth and a series of appointments to a psychologist after his teachers unanimously agreed there
                    was something wrong with him.<br><br>
                    <q>I caused my mother a lot of stress, but I don’t think I was really a mischievous kid, I was just a kid
                    who had not found his talent.</q> he says.<br><br>
                    After being expelled from a private Christian school at the end of Grade 9, Simon stumbled upon the
                    art of public speaking. In grade 10 he achieved 2nd place in his first ever schools speech competition
                    in Emalahleni. In 2005 while in Grade 11 Simon Mtsuki was elected Member of Youth Parliament of
                    Mpumalanga, after a speech to the regional council. In the same year he met Vusi Thembekwayo at a
                    Thuthuka Development Camp and took some of his advice about launching a speaking career. His
                    first motivational talk was to teachers of Hoerskool Patriot in 2005. From then on he built his profile,
                    as a motivational speaker and in 2006 (at the age of 18) he signed his first client, The South African
                    Institute of Chartered Accountants: Thuthuka Development Camp, a relationship that he has
                    maintained for the 8 years.<br><br>
                    While studying for his B.Comm Accounting at the University of the Witwatersrand he pursued his
                    speaking. He spoke to student audiences at Wits resident houses, official student events and student
                    development bodies such as the Student Sponsorship Programmes. When he graduated in 2011 he
                    decided to pursue his passion for speaking, focusing specifically on Student and Youth Development.</p>
